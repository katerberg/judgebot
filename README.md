JudgeBot is a chatbot for Discord that is designed for use in Magic TCG-related servers. It calls up rulings when called like this:

{{summoning sickness}}

You can also filter the search to a particular source file:

{{summoning sickness|CR}}

Normally it doesn't force the phrase to match exactly, but you can make it do that:

{{"summoning sickness"}}

Development is currently ongoing and the bot will be deployed when ready.

This bot was built with Javacord (https://javacord.org/) and uses data that is Â© Wizards of the Coast. The code is licensed under a variant of beerware:

Feel free to use this code for whatever as long as you credit me and you understand that I'm not liable if your server catches on fire. If you like this code and you meet me at a MagicFest or something, you can give me shiny cards.
