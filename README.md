JudgeBot is a chatbot for Discord that is designed for use in Magic TCG-related servers. It calls up rulings when called like this:

{{summoning sickness}}

You can also filter the search to a particular source file:

{{summoning sickness|CR}}

Development is currently ongoing and the bot will be deployed when ready.
