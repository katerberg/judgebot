The required minimum time limit for any match is 40 minutes.
The following time limits are recommended for each round of a tournament:
• Constructed and Limited tournaments—50 minutes
• Single-elimination quarterfinal or semifinal matches—90 minutes
• Single-elimination final matches—no time limit
The following additional time limits are recommended for Limited tournaments:

events that take place on the weekend of a new set release, 15 additional minutes for deck
construction is recommended.

The Head Judge of the tournament is the final authority on time limits for a tournament. However, any deviation
from these recommendations must be announced prior to and during tournament registration.
Magic Premier Tournaments may have different time limits. These time limits can be found in the tournament or
tournament series fact sheet.
In timed rounds, players must wait for the officially tracked time to begin before starting their match.

Appendix C—Tiebreaker Explanation
Match Points
Players earn 3 match points for each match win, 0 points for each match loss and 1 match point for each match
ending in a draw. Players receiving byes are considered to have won the match.
• A player's record is 6–2–0 (Wins–Losses–Draws). That player has 18 match points (6*3, 2*0, 0*1).
• A player's record is 4–2–2. That player has 14 match points (4*3, 2*0, 2*1).
Game Points
Game points are similar to match points in that players earn 3 game points for each game they win and 1 point for
each game that ends in a draw, and 0 points for any game lost. Unfinished games are considered draws. Unplayed
games are worth 0 points.
• A player wins a match 2–0–0, so they earn 6 game points and their opponent receives 0 game points
from the match.
• A player wins a match 2–1–0, so they earn 6 game points and their opponent earns 3 game points
from the match.
• A player wins a match 2–0–1, so they earn 7 game points and their opponent earns 1 game point from
the match.
Match-win percentage
A player’s match-win percentage is that player’s accumulated match points divided by the total match points
possible in those rounds (generally, 3 times the number of rounds played). If this number is lower than 0.33, use
0.33 instead. The minimum match-win percentage of 0.33 limits the effect low performances have when
calculating and comparing opponents’ match-win percentage.
Examples:
These three players competed in an 8-round tournament, although only the first player completed all rounds.
Tournament
Record Match Points Rounds Played Match-win
Percentage
5-2-1 16 8 16/(8*3) = 0.667
1-3-0, then
withdraws 3 4 3/(4*3) = 0.25, so
0.33 is used.
3-2-0, including a
first-round bye, then
withdraws
9 5 9/(5*3) = 0.60
Game-win percentage
Similar to the match-win percentage, a player’s game-win percentage is the total number of game points they
earned divided by the total game points possible (generally, 3 times the number of games played). Again, use 0.33
if the actual game-win percentage is lower than that.
48
These two players competed in a four-round tournament:
Game Record by Match Game Points Games
Played
Game-win
Percentage
• Round 1: 2 wins (6 game points)
• Round 2: 2 wins and 1 loss (6 game points)
• Round 3: 1 win and 2 losses (3 game points)
• Round 4: 2 wins (6 game points)
21 10 21/(3*10) = 0.70
• Round 1: 1 win and 2 losses (3 game points)
• Round 2: 1 win and 2 losses (3 game points)
• Round 3: 2 losses (0 game points)
• Round 4: 1 win and 2 losses (3 game points)
9 11 9/(3*11) = 0.27, so
0.33 is used.
Opponents’ match-win percentage
A player’s opponents’ match-win percentage is the average match-win percentage of each opponent that player
faced (ignoring those rounds for which the player received a bye). Use the match-win percentage definition listed
above when calculating each individual opponent’s match-win percentage.
Examples:
• A player’s record in an eight-round tournament is 6–2–0. Her opponents’ match records were: 4–4–0,
7–1–0, 1–3–1, 3–3–1, 6–2–0, 5–2–1, 4–3–1, and 6–1–1, so her opponents’ match-win percentage is:
• Another player’s record at the same tournament was 6–2–0. His opponents’ records were: bye, 7–1–0,
1–3–1, 3–3–1, 6–2–0, 5–2–1, 4–3–1, and 6–1–1, so his opponents’ match-win percentage is:
49
Opponents’ game-win percentages
Similar to opponents’ match-win percentage, a player’s opponents’ game-win percentage is simply the average
game-win percentage of all that player’s opponents. And, as with opponents’ match-win percentage, each
opponent has a minimum game-win percentage of 0.33.
Byes
When a player is assigned a bye for a round, they are considered to have won the match 2–0.
Thus, that player earns 3 match points and 6 game points. A player’s byes are ignored when computing their
opponents’ match-win and opponents’ game-win percentages.

Appendix E—Recommended Number of Rounds in Swiss Tournaments
The following number of Swiss rounds is required for Premier tournaments (such as Magic Tabletop Mythic
Qualifiers). It may be used at the Tournament Organizer’s discretion for non-Premier tournaments.
Grand Prix Trials and Magic Tabletop Mythic Qualifiers that are run at MagicFest events have special structures.
Participants in Grand Prix Trials or Magic Tabletop Mythic Qualifiers at MagicFest events should refer to the fact
sheet for a MagicFest event for information on the structure of those tournaments.
Players (Teams) Swiss Rounds Playoff
4 (Team/2HG Only) 2 Single-Elimination
Rounds (No Swiss) None (Run Single Elimination)
5-8 3 Single-Elimination
Rounds (No Swiss) None (Run Single Elimination)
9-16
4 (if Limited Format with
Booster Draft in Playoff)

Top 8 (If Limited Format with
Booster Draft in Playoff)

65-128 7 Top 8
129-226 8 Top 8
227-409 9 Top 8
410+ 10 Top 8
Team tournaments consider each team as a single player for this purpose.
In tournaments where awarded byes are used, each player with a 1-round bye should count as 2 players, each
player with a 2-round bye should count as 4 players, and each player with a 3-round bye should count as 8 players
when using the above chart.
